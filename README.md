# WLEDxSignalRGB
Script to let SignalRGB control WLED setups

Tutorial:

For this connection to work, you will need a microcontroller (a.e. Arduino micro) that can run the Corsair Lighting Protocol: 
https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol
Follow the Tutorial there as usual, expect for the last step, where you want to flash a modified sketch to the MCU.
You can configure the controller in SignalRGB as usual.
Then start the python script and configure the settings.


You can still connect LEDs to the controller, so if you already have a setup with the CLP you can integrate with easily
